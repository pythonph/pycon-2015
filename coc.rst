Code of Conduct
===============
.. admonition:: Taken from PyCon Ph 2014. Update for PyCon Ph 2015.


Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, status, sexual
images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they
deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns,
please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

.. [Conference staff can be identified by
.. t-shirts/special badges/head sets.]

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
