Python Philippines Community Panel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Phillipines has many Python community groups, distributed among different regions of the country. We have gathered representatives from Python.PH, PizzaPy, PyTsada, DurianPy, SugarPy, WaterPy, and PyLadies on this panel. They will share their experiences in starting their groups, their events, their community, and tips on how to start a community group.

Moderator: **Mark Steve Samson**


PizzaPy
^^^^^^^

PizzaPy started out as two fat bearded guys meeting up for pizza and beer to talk about Python and technology. They thought it was a good idea to invite other people and make companies pay for their pizza and beer. 

waterPy
^^^^^^^

Community of enthusiasts committed to promote Python, its associated technologies and practices in Region X. And to collaborate with existing Pythonistas in the region, throughout Philippines and the world. Learn and enjoy python together

DurianPy
^^^^^^^^
Davao's Python Community -- where Pythonistas and enthusiasts gather to discuss trends and share knowledge about the IT industry over a pack of Durian candies (not always). Fresh talks and friendly conversations, guaranteed!

PyTsada
^^^^^^^
ITG-PyTsada or simply "PyTsada" is a group for sharing Python and Python-related stuff, organizing meetups, events, promotion of Python in education, among others, here in Cagayan de Oro City and nearby areas. 

# It is a focus group or subgroup of the CDO Information Technology Group or ITG-X, which is a larger group of IT enthusiasts, hobbyists, hackers, and professionals in CDO.
