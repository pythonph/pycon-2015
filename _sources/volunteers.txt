Volunteers
==========

PyCon Philippines is run by volunteers. The previous PyCons would not have been
successful without the help of these individuals. This year will not be different.

The spirit of volunteerism is what makes the Python community and tech events like PyCon distinctly inspiring. Below are the list of people who stepped up to bring you PyCon Philippines 2015:
