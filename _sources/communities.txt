Python.PH
---------

`Python.PH <https://twitter.com/pythonph>`_ is a community in the Philippines for enthusiasts and users of the Python programming language. Our aim is to show that Python has something for everyone: from hobbyists, to educators, to professionals.

The group started back in 2007 when `Jun Auza <http://www.junauza.com/>`_ of Tech Source blogged about forming a local Python User's Group. `JM Maranan <https://twitter.com/jmmaranan>`_ stumbled upon the post and created a Google group.

In June 31-July 1 2012, we held the first ever PyCon Philippines. Today, we continue to organize the yearly PyCon and `monthly meet-ups <http://www.meetup.com/pythonph/>`_ for knowledge sharing and some pizza.

PizzaPy
-------

`PizzaPy <http://www.meetup.com/PizzaPy-PH/>`_ started out as two fat bearded `guys <https://twitter.com/dar9000>`_ meeting up for pizza and beer to talk about Python and technology. They thought it was a good idea to invite other people and make companies pay for their pizza and beer.
